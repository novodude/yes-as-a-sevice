# 💅 Yes-as-a-Service

Ever wanted to sprinkle a little extra sass and confidence into your yeses? Yaaas queen! 💖💅
This fabulous API serves up random, witty, and unapologetically enthusiastic affirmative responses — perfect for any scenario: personal wins, dev life, student life, or just because you deserve it.

Think of it as revenge for all those times the world said "no" — your very own [No-as-a-Service](https://naas.isalman.dev/no) nemesis, but make it sparkle.

Built for humans, confidence, and unapologetic joy.
